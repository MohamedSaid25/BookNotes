	<form method="post" action="">


	int action=""

		* the default is that assume you are in your wep app
		that's mean it's now in
			action lOOk like that =>  action="myApp/"
			but you see look like that => action=""


			so if you say at action => action="/s"

			/  => mean the server name (ROOT)

			so if you say "/" at the beginning you must say the full path
			look like that => action="/myapp/form.html"


			[OR]

				as default is that your app who is opened look like that /myapp/
				just mention what you want to access
