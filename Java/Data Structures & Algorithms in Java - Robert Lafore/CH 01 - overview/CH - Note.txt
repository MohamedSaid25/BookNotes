data structures => 
A data structure is an arrangement of data in a computer’s memory (or sometimes on a disk). Data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, binary trees, and hash tables, among others


Algorithms =>
manipulate the data in these structures in various ways, such as searching for a particular data item and sorting the data



----------------------------- Summary -------------------------
• A data structure is the organization of data in a computer’s memory or in a
disk file.
• The correct choice of data structure allows major improvements in program
efficiency.
• Examples of data structures are arrays, stacks, and linked lists.
• An algorithm is a procedure for carrying out a particular task.
• In Java, an algorithm is usually implemented by a class method.
• Many of the data structures and algorithms described in this book are most
often used to build databases.
• Some data structures are used as programmer’s tools: They help execute an
algorithm.
• Other data structures model real-world situations, such as telephone lines
running between cities.
• A database is a unit of data storage composed of many similar records.
• A record often represents a real-world object, such as an employee or a car part.
• A record is divided into fields. Each field stores one characteristic of the object
described by the record.
• A key is a field in a record that’s used to carry out some operation on the data.
For example, personnel records might be sorted by a LastName field.
• A database can be searched for all records whose key field has a certain value.
This value is called a search key
