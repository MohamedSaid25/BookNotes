			Visiabiliy problem happen casue of that cpu has it's own registers & Caches so he save local var
			there to make R & W Faster than dealing with memory that's good but the problem is that when the 
			the programm is mutithreads say 2 : and they had shared variables
			if th1 edit varible things gona writin in memory and the other th2 will never know that
			so we should r & w direct to the memory we can use volitle keyword
