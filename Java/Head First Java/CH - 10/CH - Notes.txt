=> a static method mean the method "Behavior not dependent on  an instance variable , so no instance / object is required so you can use " just class


=> as we say static method don't know anything about class thing
   even if you make instance (object ) and make it call this static method

=> static variable not live in the object !!!!!!!!!!!
 what live in object is just copy of it  look like all have copy from value that in class 
 	think of it like not live in object it live in class


=> Note Name convention of "static Final" variables is ?
	
	className_nameOfVar 
	ex=> Animal_count  ,  Play_m


Final LookLike constant
	
	should initilazed at one this two places 

		1 - decleration => public static final int x = 5;
		2 - static block =>   static {

										x = 46464;
									}



=> round negitve done for min 
	if you think about it it's right as u increase your value is less
	round(-24.8) => -25
	round(24.8)  =>  25


=> General Rule !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	anything out of ArrayList is just an object
	compiler can make auto cast when all same type

=> AutoBoxing just mean auto convert primitive to Wrapper objects
	
	int - Integer 
	float - Float
	double  - Double
