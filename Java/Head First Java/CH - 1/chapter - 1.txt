- every thing in java goes into a class 
  src code file (.java) => bytecode(.class)
  so when you run the app you really run a class

- your programm start with main funcation whatever program is big  it will start running the        
  main method and run all codes inside it untill is over

- note that while(condition) not like c++ converted auto to boolean you should do what ever you    
  want with bool conditions ex => while(c==0) || while(a) Error..!!!
  why ? as intergers and booleans are not compatiable type in java the only type that can work like that is boolean variables => boolean x = 1; while(x){..do something new ..}
