=> In generics, “extends” means “extends or implements”
=>in generics, the keyword “extends” really means “is-a”, and works for BOTH classes and interfaces



=> so to deal with dublicated you must 
	override => hashcode() & equal()


=> Hashset vs TreeSet

 Hashset | just add elements with no duplicated  if you override hashcode and equal
 and keep them without order !!!!!!!!!

 Treeset | keep them sorted so you must implements interface Comparable and override compareTo()

 	@Override
    public int compareTo(Song o) {
        return this.title.compareTo(o.getTitle());
    }


hashset => element not sorted and may not as you insert them  no gurantee for anything



TreeSet sorting =>
	
	1 - no parameters for constructor you must  implements interface Comparable and override compareTo()
	2 - Compartor Class [External Class] and make new instance and send in TreeSet constructor


HashMap = >>
	

       HashMap<String , Integer> map = new HashMap<String , Integer>(); // Must accept two OBJECT 
       
       map.put("moahmed",7);   // add by put(,);
       
        System.out.println(map.get("a")); // get by get(key);
