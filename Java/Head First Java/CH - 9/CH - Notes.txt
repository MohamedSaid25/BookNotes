	Variables	----- Instance variables (class Variable / Fields / Statses) Live in Heap
				----- Local variables 	 (Methods Variables) Live in Stack

=> Remember the three steps of object creation 
	1 - Create ref var
	2 - Create Obj
	3 - assign them

......................................... Constructor ................................................

=> Constructor first thing run when class is created and even done before step 3 above
   before assign obj that created in heap to ref var 

=> Constructor don't inherited !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

=> Constructor Can used to initilize state of you class
 	 (state = instance variables = class variable = Fileds) 

=> overloaded constructor look like methods overloading give you multi options to choose from when the 
  obj at creation process


=> Dead object / variable  mean pushed out of stack or heap 

=> inorder to local variable to be persistance so you can access it and play with it 
   you need the method that contain this variables to be in the top of stack frame
